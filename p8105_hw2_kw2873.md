### problem 1

``` r
### basic manipulation for dataset
Wheel_data = 
   readxl::read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",sheet = 1,
                      range = "A2:N408" ) %>%
   janitor::clean_names() %>%
   drop_na(dumpster) %>%
   mutate(
   sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls) 
   )
```

``` r
### clean and modify data set for precipitation in 2017
preci_2017_data =
  readxl::read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
                     sheet = 4,range = "A2:B14") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  janitor::clean_names()  %>%
  mutate( year = 2017) 


### clean and modify dataset for precipitation in 2018
preci_2018_data =
  readxl::read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
                     sheet = 4,range = "A2:B14") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  janitor::clean_names()  %>%
  mutate( year = 2018) 

### combiing dataset for precipitation in 2017 and 2018 
preci_17_18_data =
   bind_rows(preci_2017_data, preci_2018_data) %>%
   mutate(month = month.name[month]
   )
```

There are 344observations in Wheel\_data dataset, and 12 observations in
preci\_17\_18\_data. Wheel\_data dataset contains data of344 dumpsters
from2014-05-16 to 2019-06-17. The total precipitation in 2018 is 16.67,
and the total precipitation in 2017 is 16.67. The median number of
sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8

### problem 2

``` r
### manipulation pols monts data
pols_months_data = 
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(col = mon, into = c("year","month","day")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
  starts_with("prez"),
  names_to = "president",
   names_prefix = "prez_",
   values_to = "value") %>%
   filter(!(value == "0")) %>%   
   select(year, month, everything(), -value, -day) %>%
   mutate(year = as.character(year), month = month.name[as.numeric(month)])
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
### manipulation of snp.csv
snp_data = 
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(col = date, into = c("day","month","year"),sep = "/") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) %>%
  select(year,month, day, close) %>%
  arrange(year,month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
### manipulation of unemployment.csv
unemployment_data = 
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
     cols = jan:dec,
     names_to = "month",
     values_to = "umemployment value"
     ) %>%
 mutate(year = as.character(year), month = replace(month, values = month.name),
        )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
### joining dataset
merged_data = 
  left_join(pols_months_data, snp_data, by = c("year","month")) %>% 
  left_join(., unemployment_data, by = c("year","month"))
```

In pols\_months\_data, there are 822 observations of 9 variables related
to the number of national politicians who are democratic or republic at
any given time. There are date varaibles, number of republican or
democratic governors/senators/representatives/president on the
associated date. The range of dates is from 1949 to 2015. Some of the
key variables are president and year.

In the dataset of snp\_data, there are 787 observations of 4 variables
related to Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S\&P), often used as a
representative measure of stock market as a whole. There are year, month
and close values of the S\&P stock index on the associated date. The
range of dates is from 1950 to 2015. Some of the key variables are
close, year and month. In the dataset called unemployment\_data, there
are 816 observations of 3 variables related to the precentage of
unemployment on the associated dates, which is pretty self-explanatory.
The range of dates is from

In the dataset of merged\_data, this is pretty much the same with what
was stated above, because this dataset is just a combination of all
three datasets above. There are 1391 observations of 12 variables.
